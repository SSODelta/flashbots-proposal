# MEV and Stackelberg Attacks

Follow this template for new research proposals, removing this text and replacing the *Flashbots Research Proposal Template* title with your proposal's own. Open a pull request to submit your proposal, using an abbreviated title in the filename (`proposal-short_title.md`), and put the file under the `FRPs` folder.

Use this initial section to provide a ~500 word summary of the proposal. The summary should consist in a simple straightforward statement of what your hypothesis is, what methodology you intend to use, what limitations those methods may have, what implications your results may have.

## Background and Problem Statement
Provide motivation and background for the proposal, and clearly state the research questions it aims to tackle. Link to related or dependent Research Question(s) on the Flashbots Research Roadmap, and reference relevant Github Issues in this repository.
